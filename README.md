### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

my name is Benjamin and the wonderful city of Dresden (Germany) is where I am living. Iâ€™ve been working as a Cloud Software Developer for [Volkswagen](https://github.com/volkswagen) since 2019. I mainly work on [AWS](https://github.com/aws) and choose [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) whenever and wherever I can. If I happen to develop a frontend, I always use [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs).
