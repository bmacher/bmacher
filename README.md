### Hi there 👋

my name is Benjamin and the wonderful city of Dresden (Germany) is where I am living. I’ve been working as a Cloud Software Developer for [@volkswagen](https://github.com/volkswagen) since 2019. I mainly work on [@aws](https://github.com/aws) and choose [@TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) whenever and wherever I can. If I happen to develop a frontend, I always use [@vuejs](https://github.com/vuejs).
